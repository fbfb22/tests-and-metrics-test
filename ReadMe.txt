Readme. Notes:

- This project is done on windows that's why getopt.h is added.
- If this was written in C++, it could have been much more elegant. It had to be written in C.
- Time was too short to improve and test everything.
- CURL is hidden from the user.
- Another implementation can be registered by calling Ntt-Register function.
- There was no time to create a library from ntt.c and curl_imp.c
- The program is not 100% tested.
- There was no time to write a makefile. Visual studio was used to comile and test.
- Many other things that have to be improved.
